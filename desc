Game:
1. Aerial combat -> 3d viewport
2. Sensory immersion
3. Physics simulation
4.

Plan:
Phase 1:
    Objective:
    * I should visualize the structure moving in 3-d Space
    * Should have preliminary movement capability in space

    Implementation:
    -- Move particle -> validate movement in space
    -- Automate movement [Rotation & revolution]
        -- Point to neighbour dynamics

    Insights:

Phase 2:
    Objective:
    * Game dev life cycle: Tools
        -- Gameplay and UX phase-I draft
    * I should visualize the structure moving in 3-d Space
        -- Create: Use easy means to create structures [elemental structure library]
        -- Populate: Populate structures in game world
        -- Optimize: Optimize structure store format for algorithms

        Cams:
        -- Create cams
        -- Create analysis viewports

    * Rudimentary Gui

    * Link Current game movement features with game world [Modularity]
    * Dev features:
        -- Git integration

Features:
    Online game server
    Modularity -> recreate games based on sub systems
    Documentation [Architecture, ops, insights, logs]
    Next gen tech: Sensory ascension[emulate and enhance gameplay][VR],
